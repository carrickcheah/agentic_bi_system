        1. System Prompt Length - Practical Considerations
        5000 words is likely too long. Here's what works best in practice:
        Optimal Length Ranges:

        200-800 words: Most effective for focused, single-purpose roles
        800-1500 words: Good for complex roles with multiple responsibilities
        1500-2500 words: Maximum recommended for highly specialized roles
        Beyond 2500 words: Diminishing returns, potential for confusion

        Why Shorter is Often Better:

        Attention span: LLMs can lose focus with overly long prompts
        Clarity: Concise instructions are less ambiguous
        Performance: Shorter prompts leave more tokens for actual work
        Maintenance: Easier to update and refine

        Sweet Spot for Business Analyst:
        1200-1800 words would be ideal - comprehensive enough to cover the complexity of data analysis while remaining focused and actionable.
