## Integration & Complementarity

| Integration Aspect | How They Work Together |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Storage Backend** | GraphRAG can use LanceDB to store node/edge embeddings |
| **Hybrid Retrieval** | LanceDB for initial similarity filtering → GraphRAG for relationship reasoning |
| **Multi-Modal** | LanceDB handles diverse embeddings → GraphRAG structures relationships |
| **Scalability** | LanceDB provides efficient storage → GraphRAG adds reasoning layer |
| **Performance** | LanceDB for fast retrieval → GraphRAG for comprehensive understanding |

## Recommended Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Layered Approach
```
Query → LanceDB (fast filtering) → GraphRAG (relationship reasoning) → Response
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Processing
```
Query → [LanceDB similarity search] + [GraphRAG graph traversal] → Merged results
```

### Pattern 3: Context-Aware Selection
```
Query analysis → Route to LanceDB (simple) OR GraphRAG (complex) → Response
```

## Decision Matrix

| If Your Use Case Requires... | Choose | Rationale |
|------------------------------|---------|-----------|
| Fast semantic search at scale | **LanceDB** | Optimized for speed and efficiency |
| Complex reasoning over relationships | **GraphRAG** | Designed for narrative understanding |
| Both speed AND reasoning | **Both (Hybrid)** | Leverage strengths of each approach |
| Simple document retrieval | **LanceDB** | Sufficient for straightforward similarity |
| Research/analysis workflows | **GraphRAG** | Better for discovering hidden connections |
| Multi-modal similarity search | **LanceDB** | Handles diverse embedding types |
| Global document understanding | **GraphRAG** | Provides comprehensive context |

## Conclusion

**They are complementary, not redundant.** LanceDB provides the efficient vector storage and retrieval infrastructure, while GraphRAG adds sophisticated reasoning capabilities through knowledge graph structures. The optimal approach often combines both:

- **LanceDB** as the fast, scalable retrieval engine
- **GraphRAG** as the intelligent reasoning layer that understands relationships and context

This hybrid approach maximizes both performance and understanding quality in production RAG systems.
