# 🏗️ Complete Architecture Study - Agentic SQL Backend

## 📋 **Executive Summary**

This is an **Autonomous Business Intelligence System** that works like **"Claude Code for Business Data"** - autonomously investigating business questions through intelligent planning, execution, and organizational learning.

### **Core Mission**
Transform natural language business questions into strategic insights while building organizational intelligence through sophisticated caching and knowledge sharing.

## 🎯 **Three Revolutionary Principles**

1. **Business Intelligence First, Technology Second**
   - Understands business context, not just SQL syntax
   - Applies domain knowledge (sales cycles, fiscal calendars, business rules)
   - Generates strategic recommendations, not just data dumps

2. **Autonomous Investigation, Not Query Translation**
   - Self-planning investigation strategies
   - Adaptive methodology based on findings
   - Self-healing error recovery and hypothesis evolution

3. **Organizational Learning, Not Individual Tools**
   - Every investigation benefits the entire organization
   - Multi-tier caching with knowledge sharing
   - Pattern recognition and continuous improvement

## 🔄 **Complete Process Flow**

### **Phase 0: Cache Check System** 
*Multi-tier cache lookup before any investigation*

**Architecture**:
```
MultiTierCacheManager orchestrates:
├── Tier 1a: AnthropicCacheClient (50ms target)
├── Tier 1b: PostgreSQLCacheClient (100ms target)  
└── Tier 2: SemanticCacheClient (200ms target)
```

**Process**:
1. **Anthropic Cache Check** (50ms)
   - Organization-wide conversation sharing
   - 90% cost savings when cache hit
   - Managed TTL by Anthropic (5min - 24hrs)

2. **PostgreSQL Hybrid Cache Check** (100ms)
   - **Personal Cache**: User-specific insights with permissions
   - **Organizational Cache**: Team-shared business intelligence
   - Permission-aware access control via JSONB arrays
   - Dynamic TTL managed by TTL Manager

3. **Semantic Cache Check** (200ms)
   - Vector similarity search in Qdrant
   - Pattern matching and learning
   - Indefinite storage for organizational learning

**Cache Hit**: Return results instantly (50ms-200ms)
**Cache Miss**: Proceed to Five-Phase Investigation
