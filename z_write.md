Ultra-deep thinking to plan, We go one by one, step by step.

  1. API Authentication Failures  ( Ignore, i purposely fallback to OpenAI GPT-4.1-nano)


  2. Performance Bottlenecks

  - Qdrant Search: 1300-1900ms (19x slower than 100ms target)
  - Schema Analysis: 30s timeout with 292 tables ( Why direct access 292 tables????so slow Before that, it should follow the flow)
  - Empty Qdrant Collection: 0 matches for all queries ( Impossible 0 matches, i tested in Qdrant module, it is work)

  3. Architecture Scalability

  - 292 tables in MariaDB causing analysis timeouts
  - No table filtering or prioritization
  - Synchronous schema analysis blocking investigation ( block???)

  ðŸŸ¡ System Strengths

  1. Robust Fallback Chain: Gracefully handles model failures
  2. Cache Implementation: Working correctly (3rd query hits cache)
  3. Intent Classification: Accurately identifies query types
  4. MCP Integration: Successfully connects to MariaDB

Now which file control the flow???
