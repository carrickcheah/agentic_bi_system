Summary what we done today. I want save into this file. So other teams members read this report, they can have right context, and follw up      │
│   detail. Help them continue the unfinish works.        










Now i wan create my workflow. Import diffrent module and run in main.py .
I go one by one, step by step.

First, model. i want init model in main.py.
so i want brainstorm with u. 
Now i understand runner is the entry, i import all files/functions from these files.
So in main.py, i onli need to from model.runner import functions xx to init model or use function correct? or i need import class to use all function if i want to?  Ultra-deep thinking to advice
