I've switched from coding to architect - now I design and manage 10 AI team members instead of writing code myself! 

Each has custom prompts for their specialty: my SQL agent knows databases, my LLM agent has ML engineering skills, and my testing agent automatically tests every script. It's like having a whole virtual team.

My approach is straightforward - clear communication with XML tags, specialized skills for each domain, structured workflows with clear handoffs, concrete success examples, and unified memory for collaboration. 

With Claude Code, I can now handle complete projects start to finish - design, build, and ship. It's like having a full development team at my fingertips!
