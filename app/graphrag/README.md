# GraphRAG + LanceDB Integration Plan

## Current State Analysis
- **Existing**: Functional LanceDB system with business pattern ingestion and vector search
- **Discovery**: Microsoft GraphRAG natively supports LanceDB as a vector backend
- **Opportunity**: Your `/app/graphrag/` directory is ready for GraphRAG integration

## Phase 1: GraphRAG Foundation Setup
1. **Install Microsoft GraphRAG** in your project environment using `uv add graphrag`
2. **Initialize GraphRAG configuration** in `/app/graphrag/` directory
3. **Configure GraphRAG to use LanceDB backend** (same database as your existing system)
4. **Create sample knowledge graph** from subset of business patterns
5. **Test GraphRAG's entity extraction and relationship mapping**

## Phase 2: Data Model Integration
1. **Analyze GraphRAG's document format** vs your current business pattern structure
2. **Create conversion pipeline** from your JSON patterns ’ GraphRAG documents
3. **Design hybrid schema** that supports both vector search and graph queries
4. **Implement data synchronization** between existing LanceDB tables and GraphRAG indices

## Phase 3: Enhanced Query Capabilities
1. **Build graph-based pattern discovery** using entity relationships
2. **Implement community detection** to group related business patterns
3. **Add multi-hop reasoning** for complex pattern recommendations
4. **Create hybrid search interface** (vector similarity + graph traversal)

## Phase 4: Advanced Business Intelligence
1. **Extract business entities** (departments, processes, KPIs) from patterns
2. **Map cross-domain relationships** between business patterns
3. **Build knowledge graph visualization** for pattern relationships
4. **Implement advanced analytics** on pattern usage and effectiveness

## Technical Architecture
- **LanceDB**: Shared vector storage for both systems
- **Your System**: Fast vector search and pattern ingestion
- **GraphRAG**: Knowledge graph construction and graph queries
- **Integration Layer**: Unified API combining both capabilities

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Discovery**: Find patterns through relationships, not just similarity
- **Business Intelligence**: Understand how patterns connect across domains
- **Advanced Recommendations**: Multi-dimensional pattern suggestions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Leverage both vector and graph search strengths
