## Simple Analogy

**Like a Detective Conducting an Investigation:**

- **Detective** (AI Engine): Uses reasoning and experience to solve cases
- **Evidence** (Coordinated Services): Different sources of information (witnesses, forensics, records)
- **Investigation Process**: Follow leads, test theories, adapt approach based on findings
- **Case Report** (Phase 6 Input): Organized findings ready for prosecutor (insight synthesis)

The detective doesn't just collect evidence - they **reason about it**, **form hypotheses**, and **adapt their investigation** based on what they discover. Phase 5 is the detective work, Phase 6 is writing the final case report.

## Important Points

1. **AI-Driven Autonomy**: Uses Claude's reasoning capabilities for genuine autonomous investigation, not just query execution

2. **Hypothesis-Driven Analysis**: AI generates and tests business hypotheses, evolving theories based on findings

3. **Adaptive Methodology**: Investigation approach changes dynamically based on real-time discoveries

4. **Business Intelligence Focus**: Applies domain knowledge and business context throughout the investigation

5. **Service Integration**: Leverages Phase 4's coordinated services without duplicating orchestration logic

6. **Error Recovery**: Intelligent fallback strategies when data sources fail or queries error

7. **Confidence Scoring**: AI assesses reliability of its own findings and provides confidence metrics

8. **Zero External Dependencies**: Self-contained module following project architecture standards

9. **Real-Time Adaptation**: Investigation plan evolves as new information is discovered

10. **Quality Validation**: Cross-validates findings across multiple data sources for reliability
