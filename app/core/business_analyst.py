Autonomous Business Analyst - Main Orchestrator

The central autonomous business intelligence system that implements the three
revolutionary principles and orchestrates five-phase investigations.

Revolutionary Principles:
1. Business Intelligence First, Technology Second
2. Autonomous Investigation, Not Query Translation
3. Organizational Learning, Not Individual Tools

Five-Phase Workflow:
1. Query Processing - Natural language to business intent
2. Strategy Planning - Investigation methodology selection  
3. Service Orchestration - Database service coordination
4. Investigation Execution - Autonomous multi-step analysis
5. Insight Synthesis - Strategic recommendations generation
