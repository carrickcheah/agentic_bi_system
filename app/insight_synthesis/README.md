```python
from app.insight_synthesis import InsightSynthesizer, OutputFormat

# Initialize synthesizer
synthesizer = InsightSynthesizer()

# Synthesize insights from investigation results
result = await synthesizer.synthesize_insights(
    investigation_results=investigation_data,
    business_context={

        "strategic_goal": "15% efficiency improvement",
        "business_unit": "Manufacturing Division"
    },
    user_role="manager",
    output_format=OutputFormat.DETAILED_REPORT
)

# Access generated insights
for insight in result.insights:
    print(f"Insight: {insight.title}")
    print(f"Confidence: {insight.confidence:.2f}")
    print(f"Business Impact: {insight.business_impact}")

# Access recommendations
for rec in result.recommendations:
    print(f"Recommendation: {rec.title}")
    print(f"Priority: {rec.priority}")
    print(f"Timeline: {rec.timeline}")
```
